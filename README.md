I recently got a job at a rails shop, and I haven't done much rails recently.  As such, I'm doing a few small projects to refamiliarize myself with it.

This is just a simple game, reminiscent of old-school text-based adventures (minus the text processing).  I'll start out with locations and the ability to travel between them, then I'll add items and changing state over time.  I'll probably get bored of this and move on to a new project before I get too far; we'll see.
